## Tech Stack

- Flutter SDK: [Version]
- State Management: [Provider.]
- HTTP Client: [http]
- Persistence: [shared_preferences]

## State Management Explanation

[The app uses the `Provider` package for state management due to its simplicity and efficiency in
managing widget rebuilds. The `ArticleProvider` class handles fetching articles from the API,
filtering them based on search input, managing favorite items, and updating UI through
`notifyListeners()`. This makes the app reactive and modular, separating logic from UI.
]

## Known Issues / Limitations

[- No pagination: All articles are fetched at once, which may not scale well with large datasets.
- Uses static API (`jsonplaceholder.typicode.com`) that doesnâ€™t update or support dynamic content.
- UI design is basic and can be improved with animations or better responsive handling on tablets.
